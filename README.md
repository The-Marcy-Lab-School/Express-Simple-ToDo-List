# Express Simple To-Do List

## Directions
You are to make a simple To-Do List using the Express framework. Your project should fullfill the following UX requirements. Users should be able to:
  * View a list of tasks
  * Create a task
  * Delete a task
  * Update a task
  * Mark a task complete
  * (Optional) View a single task

Your code must meet the following requirements:
  * Core app logic must be encapsulated using classes.
  * Have basic styling (feel free to reference a CSS library CDN).
  * Generally, code should be clean and well-organize. (ESLint is highly encourage.)
  * **The data does not need to persists**. If you restart the server, the To-Do list will be cleared out.
